# ClimateWin---Machine Learning (Supervised)
ClimateWins wants you to assess the tools available to categorize and predict the weather in
mainland Europe. Itâ€™s concerned with the increase in extreme weather events, especially in the
past 10 to 20 years. 

# Key Questions
- How is machine learning used? Is it applicable to weather data?
- ClimateWins has heard of ethical concerns surrounding machine learning and AI. Are
there any concerns specific to this project?
- Historically, what have the maximums and minimums in temperature been?
- Can machine learning be used to predict whether weather conditions will be favorable on
a certain day? (If so, it could also be possible to predict danger.)

# Tools Used
 - Python

# Supervised Machine Learning  Algorithm Performed 
 - K-Nearest Neighbour
 - Decision Tree
 - Artificial Neural Network
